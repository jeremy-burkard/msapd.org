	In 1951, at the age of 30, Norman's mother-in-law gave him a chanter and book to help him fulfill his dream of learning to play 
	the bagpipes.  He took instruction with Donald Leslie, formerly of the Isle of Skye and the Cameron Highlanders.  In 1955 he joined 
	the MacGregor Pipe Band located in Philadelphia. Norman moved to Buffalo, NY, and there became a member of the Caledonia Pipe Band.  
	He was one of the founding members of the Ashby Massachusetts Pipe Band, and in 1976 Norman took over as Pipe Major, a position he 
	retained for 20 years.  After a move to Maine, he joined Northern Border Caledonia and subsequently became a member of Maine St. 
	Andrew's Pipes & Drums.  For health reasons, in 2006 Norman retired from piping after 55 years of joyful playing.  He resides in 
	Deer Isle with his beloved wife, Jackie, who, while never playing the pipes herself, supported Norman every step of the way.  
	His daughter-in-law is lead drummer for the Scots Highland Pipes & Drums.
