	About 45 years ago my mother took me to a performance of the Gaelic Arts College Pipe Band.  Mom had always wanted to 
	learn the highland fling, so she sent me off to the Gaelic College in St. Anns, Nova Scotia, to learn highland dance.  
	The College required me to take something in addition to highland dancing, so I signed up for bagpiping taught by Gold 
	Medalist Seumas MacNeill, and the rest is, as they say, history.  In 1975 I joined The Argyle Highlanders, soon to become 
	Northern Border Caledonia.  Under the direction of PM Ned Smith and  Drum Sergeant Anthea O'Neal, we entertained and 
	educated multicultural audiences across the state of Maine and competed successfully in Atlantic Canada and New England 
	in Grades 3 and 4, one year becoming New Brunswick Champions and the next taking 4th in our grade at the North American 
	Championships in Maxville, Ontario.  Twenty-one years later, NBC was part of the merger which created the Maine St. Andrew's 
	Pipes & Drums.  As a former Pipe Sergeant of NBC, present PS and Business Manager of MSAPD, and instructor of piping, 
	I bring my own special brand of craziness to our beloved music.  In my other life, I teach math and language arts to teens 
	and adults, study Eckankar, and live in Corinth with my two Briards and assorted dogs and cats, most rescues or throwaways.  
	Because of piping and pipe bands, I've met people and gone places I would never have otherwise.  I wouldn't have missed 
	it for the world.  I'm looking forward, with interest, to what my next 45 years of piping will bring.
