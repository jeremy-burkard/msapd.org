	Tim's first practice chanter was acquired during a trip through Nova Scotia in the mid 1990's but it took another fifteen years before he discovered the 
	Maine St. Andrew's Pipes and Drums and began taking lessons in earnest. Tim earned a doctorate studying mechanical engineering and is now employed as a 
	self taught artisan.  He runs his own nautically themed fiber gallery and antique shop, called "The Marlinespike Chandlery", located in Stonington, ME.
