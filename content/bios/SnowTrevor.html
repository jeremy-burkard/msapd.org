I had thoughts of learning the Great Highland Bagpipe about 10 years
ago after watching a graduation ceremony that used a pipe band to lead
the procession.  Shortly thereafter, I attended the Maine Highland
Games in Brunswick and purchased a reed from one of the vendors to use
in a practice chanter that had been loaned to me by a family member.
It was all up hill from there.  I learned to play but still struggled
with some elements and piping became an exercise in frustration.  I
had stopped with lessons and needed some help.<br/>
<br/>
I saw Maine St. Andrew's playing at the Fort Knox tattoo and it was
apparent from a spectator's vantage point that the group looked like
they were really having fun at the event.  A visited the website and
saw the open invitation for all interested in the band to drop by a
regularly scheduled practice.  I did and met with Scott who invited me
to stay and listen.<br/>
<br/>
As I said, it's been all up hill from there.  :)
