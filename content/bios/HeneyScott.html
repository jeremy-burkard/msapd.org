<div class="rostertext">
	Scott has been a member of the Maine St. Andrew's Pipes and Drums from its beginnings in 1994 to the present, taking the position 
	of Pipe Major when the original P/M, Donna Hawkins, left the post in 2001.<br/>
	<br/>
	Scott began chanter lessons 30-some years ago, with Ned Smith of East Holden.  After purchasing a used set of Highland pipes from 
	a family friend, he became the first apprentice in the Argyll Highlanders, also led by Ned Smith.  Attending the seminars and 
	workshops of such players as Bob Worrall, Ken Eller and Robert Mathiesson has also helped expand his knowledge of the instrument 
	and its music. Four years in the University Singers  from the University of Maine also helped add to his appreciation and knowledge 
	of performance.<br/>
	<br/>
	A change of name and additional goals transformed the Argyll Highlanders into 'Northern Border Caledonia', with which Scott performed 
	in band competitions in eastern Canada and the northeastern U.S. , two of those many years as pipe-sergeant. The band achieved 
	recognition for innovation in Grade IV, in addition to its busy schedule of parades, concerts and school appearances.<br/>
	<br/>
	A landscaper and stoneworker by trade, Scott is currently also working on his own long thought-after post and beam house in Surry, 
	ME. Noted for a quirky sense of humor, he is known for unexpectedly reciting Monty Python sketches (assisted by other band members) 
	and has been known to attempt to bring order out of chaos and instill focus in those temporarily distracted by suddenly calling out
	"At one hundred yards, volley fire - PRESENT!" (apologies to Michael Caine).
	As to why an American with an Irish name plays Scots music in Canada, he mysteriously invokes the French phrase 'Cherchez la femme'...
	with apologies to no one.
