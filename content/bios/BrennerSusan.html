	I discovered the Maine St. Andrew's Pipes and Drums the summer of 2003.  My family and I were driving around Ellsworth determined to find the live bagpipe music coming from somewhere, and were delighted to 
	find a whole band marching during a practice at the old Moore School.  I joined them that fall and have loved having the opportunity to learn true Scottish Highland side drumming alongside the pipes.<br/>
	<br/>
	My parents were born and raised in England, my mother is from Nottingham and my father is from London and moved to Nottingham in his later youth.  I have always known bagpipe music and feel a deep 
	resonance inside when I hear it, like it is calling to me.  We took a few trips to England to visit extended family when I was young, all great times, and I spent many adolescent years wishing my parents 
	had stayed in England to raise us 3 children instead of settling in Southern California.  Perhaps that is why I feel such a connection to Maine, it has a similar feel in it's climate, landscape and overall 
	essence to Great Britain, at least to the parts I got to know.<br/>
	<br/>   
	I played flute for a couple of years in elementary school but didn't go far with it.  After high school I purchased my first drum kit, loving the rhythm and feel of it, but never committing the time to 
	really learning how to play well.  It has long since been sold, but my desire to drum never went away (and this time I only have to think about and coordinate 2 hands, so much easier!).  I am grateful for 
	the opportunity to learn an instrument in my adult years, and although it has been challenging to find enough time to practice and perform around our busy family of 5, it has been so rewarding.
