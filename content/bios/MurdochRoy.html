	I began my pipeband experience as a side drummer with the New Haven Gaelic Pipeband of New Haven, Connecticut in the early 1970's. 
	Many years after setting pipebands aside upon entering the Navy, I happened past a Maine Saint Andrews rehearsal and stopped to listen. 
	I began chanter lessons soon thereafter with then pipe major, Donna Hawkins. Without a set of pipes I was on the street as the bass
	drummer until 2000, when I left the drum corp and began piping full time.<br/><br/>
	I play a set of Grainger & Campbell pipes, having relieved my brother of them after my father passed them to him. It has been an 
	enjoyable experience, playing music for people and carrying on with others in the band.<br/><br/>
	For the past few years I have helped in planning and presenting the Fort Knox Scottish Tattoo, an event which brings together many of 
	Maine's pipebands for an evening of music.
