I was born in Glasgow, Scotland, and started my drumming career when I was about 4/5 years old.  I was crazy about drumming, but my father 
wanted me to be a piper (he was a bass drummer). So, he took me to our local band, Kinning Park Pipe Band, for piping lessons, but I always 
ended up in the drummers' room.  I started playing with the band when I was nine.  We did quite well for a bunch of kids, picking up some 
trophies along the way.  After playing for three years I left, because I wanted to try something different. So, I joined the Prince Charles 
Accordion Band.  The drumming there was totally different, but because of my previous experience, I took over as the band's leading drummer.<br/><br/>

I also had another passion; I wanted to be a soldier.  Being only 16, I needed parental permission to join, which was not given.  My father 
asked me to join the Merchant Navy instead, so I thought I would give it a shot.  After two years I still wanted to be a soldier, so on my 
18th birthday I left the sea and joined Her Majestry's Forces.  While in training, I was asked if I would like to join the Royal Scots Dragoon 
Guards for their Pipes and Drums.  At the time I was happy learning to drive a tank, so I declined.  Following training, I joined The 4th Royal 
Tank Regiment (Scotland's Own), and then I got a shock.<br/><br/>

One day, while working on my vehicle (a 60 ton Chieftain Tank), I saw two guys standing in front of me in Tartan trews with an order to bring 
me to see Pete Elder (I didn't know who he was at the time), the Pipe Major of our Pipes and Drums, a unit I didn't know we had, as they had 
been away on tour.  Pete asked me to join the band, as he had seen my personnel records and knew I was a drummer.  Again I refused, still 
happy on my tank.  A couple of weeks later I was called to see our Colonel. He explained that the Regiment was taking part in a huge music 
show, Halle-Munsterland Music Festival.  Since most of the Pipe Band drum corps would be gone on training during this time, he asked if I 
would play for the weekend.  It sounded at the time like he was asking, but it really was an order, so I said, "Yes, Sir."  When I look back 
now, I realize I was set up, for when I went to the Quartermaster's, my uniform was already there and it fit like a glove (funny!).  When 
the weekend was over, I tried to return the uniform only to be told, "No way, you're in the band now."  So started a 17 year career in the 
Pipes and Drums of the 4th Royal Tank Regiment, and it was cool.<br/><br/>

Like everyone else, I started as the junior drummer and learned to play all the percussion instruments.  With the band, I played in just 
about every Military Tattoo and in almost every country in Europe, Scandinavia, Canada, USA, South America, Cyprus, Ireland, Scotland, 
and Russia.  The band competed in Pipe Band Competitions all over the world and won the Scandinavian Championships two years in a row, 
taking 12 first places out of 13.  I ended up as Lead Drummer for the band and then Drum Major for a short time, before retiring from the 
service. During my time with the band I performed many times before Queen Elizabeth and other members of the Royal Family (once also 
Highland Dancing for Her Majesty) and in five Edinburgh Tattoos, once as Senior Drum Major.  As a solo drum competitor, I won many awards, 
including Scottish Junior Army Drummer and Army Drummer.<br/><br/>

I came to the USA in 2001, to Ellsworth, Maine, and married a wonderful woman, Vicki.  I also have two daughters, Katherine and Rebecca, 
whom I drag all over the place to watch me play.  I met the Maine St. Andrew's Pipes and Drums at rehearsal one night, and it rekindled 
the spark, so I joined the band, first as drum sergeant and lead drummer and later as Drum Major.  I have brought some skills from my 
earlier life and service to the band that have helped them, as well as my mix of Military, Navy, and Glaswegian humor.  I have a thing 
about having a dress code, as the kilt is my country's national dress; so as part of my job as Drum Major, I make sure that everyone looks 
his/her best when in uniform.<br/><br/>

I think it must be fate that I traveled halfway around the world to a small town in Maine and found a pipe band.  I am proud of my (our) 
pipes and drums for the dedication everyone has in making the band work.  All take part in competitions and performances and give up their 
valuable time during the summer months to travel the State of Maine and beyond to perform with the band.  They also dedicate hours of hard 
work in the winter months to increase their skills.  This year's efforts culminated in winning, for the first time, a major competition in 
New Hampshire at the Indoor Games.  The only drawback to having a Scottish accent is the two questions I always seem to get asked:  "Do 
you play bagpipes?  (No, drums.) and "What do you wear under your kilt?" (Simple - socks and shoes.)
