	It has been my great pleasure for over twenty years to be involved in promoting my Celtic Heritage by playing in three pipe bands. 
	I started as a tenor drummer, then bass, and now snare drummer. Maine St. Andrew's is a fine organization that offers a good opportunity 
	for anyone interested in piping or drumming. We have real fine instructors who teach and I would urge anyone interested to join our 
	practice session and check us out.
