	Jeremy Burkard lives in Bowdoinham, and has been playing the bagpipes since 1995.  He had an interest in European history and had
	previously played violin, bass, trumpet, trombone, tuba and euphonium in concert, marching and jazz bands.  He met Lynn Alexander (current Pipe
	Sergeant), Donna Hawkins (former Pipe Major) and Scott Heney (current Pipe Major) through a series of bizarre social coincidences, and decided to
	learn the pipes and play with the band.  Jeremy plays MacMurchie pipes, and takes a special interest in trying new technical bits to improve the
	quality of his piping.
