	Shane began studying the bagpipes at the age of eight under the tutelage of Paula Tinker.  After two years of lessons with 
	Paula, he joined the Maine St. Andrew's Pipes and Drums in 1997.  Two summer sessions at the Gaelic College in St. Anns, 
	Nova Scotia were an influential part of Shane's early pursuit of the instrument, exposing him more broadly to the world of 
	piping. Shane left the band in 2004 to attend college in New York where he received valuable musical training in trumpet.  
	During his first three summers in college, he enjoyed, among his other duties as a living history interpreter, playing the 
	bagpipes for visitors to Grand Portage National Monument in Minnesota.   Shane currently resides in Bangor and is excited 
	to have rejoined the band.  In addition to the bagpipes and trumpet, he enjoys dabbling with numerous other instruments, 
	the more obscure the better.
