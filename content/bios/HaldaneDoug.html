	I grew up in a family that was always aware of its Scottish heritage. My father
	often played Scottish records; being an Army officer, the music featured military brass
	bands. After I graduated college in 1980, I responded to the call of the pipes and began
	learning to play. I bought a set of Grainger and Campbell pipes during a genealogical
	trip to Scotland and had the great good fortune to have them first played by Pipe Major
	Angus MacDonald of the Scots Guards in Edinburgh Castle. I played for a time, but put
	the pipes down for a number of reasons, none of them good. I returned to learning the
	pipes in 2011 and, curiously, began learning drumming at the same time.
	I was attending the band's practices to familiarize myself to the tunes the band
	played and make it easier to learn them. I was asked to try my hand at the bass drum
	since the band had an opening there. Apparently, a sense of tempo and the strength to
	carry a bass drum, sometimes for miles at a time, do not occur in the same person as often
	as one would expect.<br/>
	<br/>
	Moreover, since joining the band I've learned that although playing the music is
	always a challenge, the band members themselves are a welcoming bunch, helpful, and
	open to suggestions from a complete rookie. It is a true joy to share with them the trials
	and excitement of band competitions, the satisfaction of bringing the pleasure of the
	music to others, and the fulfillment of carrying on the heritage.
