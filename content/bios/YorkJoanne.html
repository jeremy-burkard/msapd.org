	I used to think how great it would be to play the pipes. So on one of our trips to the Highland Games in Hew Hampshire, 
	I purchased a chanter, tape, and instruction book on "How to play the bagpipes." At that time, my husband Ben played the snare drum 
	with a band. So instead of tagging along on all the band trips, I decided to join. It was then that I received good instruction. 
	I now enjoy playing with the St. Andrew's Pipes and Drums and enjoy meeting wonderful people where ever we play.
