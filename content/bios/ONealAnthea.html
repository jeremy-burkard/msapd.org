The first time I heard a pipe band was during WWII when King George came to Perth to review the 42th Regiment of the Black Watch.  
From the perspective of a 5 year old, I was disappointed that the King was wearing an Army uniform - no crown, no velvet robes, no gold 
or great jewels.  But the pipe band made up for any shortcomings of His Majesty.  Never had I heard anything so wild, so exciting.  Later, 
at home that evening, I announced to my mother that I would be a piper when I grew up.  "Don't be silly, child," was her response.  
"Girls don't play bagpipes."  Perhaps that was why I chose to learn drumming, when some 20 years later, while living in Pittsburgh, PA, 
the opportunity arose to join Clan Douglas Pipe Band of Wilkensburg, PA.  That was back in the days of rope-tension drums, and since then, 
for more than 40 years, I have been involved on and off with pipe bands, playing snare, rhythm tenor, and bass.  I started my drumming 
career at the very end of the era of rope-tension drums , and I feel privileged to have experienced the end of one era and the beginning 
of the extraordinary evolution of Highland drumming that took place mostly during the second half of the 20th century.<br/>

In 1976, I met Ned Smith at a party.  With Ned as Pipe Major and me as Drum Sergeant and lead drummer, we founded The Argyle Highlanders, 
which several years later became Northern Border Caledonia, and finally Maine St. Andrew's Pipes & Drums.  When the opportunity arose, 
I happily left the side drum line and took over the bass and rhythm tenor drums and became Midsection Leader.  In 2007 the years had 
caught up with me, and I decided to retire as a performing member.  I will always love the music and remain an associate member and 
strong supporter of the band.  And who knows, I might even step back up to the bass drum again.  Once the music is in your blood, it's 
very hard to stop.
