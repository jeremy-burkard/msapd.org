	I was introduced to the band by my daughter Anna in 2004, as she started to take side drum lessons at age 8 from Anthea O'Neal 
	and Darren Hart. She played for a year as I watched as a parent/groupie. I saw how much fun the band was having during that first 
	season, and when Anna started to think about moving on to other musical instruments not played by a pipe band, I decided to take 
	lessons to help keep her interested. Her interest continued to move toward other things as mine continued to grow toward the band. 
	She left the band the next year and I found a bit of a home in it. I enjoy all types of music, but have a special fondness for 
	Scottish, Celtic and American folk music. I also enjoy playing the bodhran at dances or just jam sessions. Making noise seems to work 
	for me.
