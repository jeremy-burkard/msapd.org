	Ceilidh has been around bagpipe bands since before she was born.  She was schlepped by her mom, Lynn Alexander, to many gigs with her
	brother and sister while growing up.  In 2001 she finally officially joined the band, originally as a bass drummer.  Despite Lynn's many efforts,
	one out of three was the best she could get.<br/>
	<br/>
	Under the mentorship of Anthea O'Neal, she soon began learning the tenor drum as well.  Ceilidh now leads the band's midsection, playing 
	competition and concert bass as well as rhythm and flourishing tenor.  She also writes beatings for tenor and bass that fit with our 
	midsection's unique sound and style of playing.  She is now learning to play the side drum with the band, which gives her a new perspective
	on how the entire drum corps plays together.<br/>
	<br/>
	Rhythm comes fairly easily to Ceilidh, with a background of 14 years of dance and musical theater.  Ceilidh shares her home with a number of 
	fuzzy friends (dogs, cats, rat and mouse), most of which enjoy the band's music.  The rest find solitude under the bed.  She is currently 
	attending college, pursuing her degree in Nursing.
