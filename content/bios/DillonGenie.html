	Genie lives in Exeter, Maine, and is a tenor drummer.  Her son, Quinn, played the bagpipes with the band until he started college.  Genie missed the 
	Scottish music as well as the camaraderie of the band members.  With a background in piano, she decided to learn tenor drumming in 2010 when her youngest 
	left for college.  Genie now performs in band concerts and competitions as a rhythm and flourishing tenor.  She is also the band's "refreshments gal"
	--encouraging fellowship with food!<br/>
	<br/>
	A former elementary teacher, Genie is married with four children, two whom are harpists.  She works part time for the City of Brewer as well as the 
	Corinth Law Office.  Residing on a 300-acre farm with memories of her youngsters' adventures has sparked her interest in writing children's books.
